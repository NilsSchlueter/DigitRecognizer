# DigitRecognizer
Simple Implementation of a 3-Layer Neural Network in Python, used do recognize handwritten Digits.

This project was meant to implement a simple Neural Network from scratch without libraries such as Tensorflow, ScikitLearn etc.
It includes an Implementation of the Backpropagation Algorithm as well as two other learning function (ERS and ERS2)
